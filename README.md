# Priority Queue
This repository contains a C++ implementation of a priority queue data structure. The priority queue is implemented as a templated class in the "priority_queue.hpp" header file, and there is a sample usage of the priority queue in the "test.cpp" file.
# Files in this Repository
- priority_queue.hpp: This header file contains the implementation of the priority_queue class template. The priority_queue class allows you to create a priority queue with a specified capacity, enqueue elements with priorities, dequeue elements, and perform other common priority queue operations.
- test.cpp: This is a sample program that demonstrates how to use the priority_queue class. It creates a priority_queue with a capacity of 10, enqueues elements with priorities, dequeues elements, and prints information about the queue's size and contents.
# How to Use
To use the priority queue in your own C++ program.
- Include the "priority_queue.hpp" header in your source code.
- Create an instance of the priority_queue class, specifying the desired capacity.
- Use the various member functions of the priority_queue class to perform operations on the queue. Some common operations include enqueue, dequeue, push, pop, size, and empty. Refer to the "test.cpp" file for usage examples.
- Compile your program, including both "priority_queue.hpp" and your source code file.
